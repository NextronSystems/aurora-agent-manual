Configuration
=============

A typical configuration file would look like this 

.. code::bash
 
   # Paths to your rule files
   rules-path: 
      - .\rules
      - %ProgramData%\my-sigma-rules
   # The location of log source mapping configurations
   sigma-config: 
      - .\sigma-config.yml
   # Only sigma rule matches of this level and higher will be logged (informational, low, medium, high, critical)
   reporting-level: high
   # Event matching log output streams
   log-outputs:
      eventlog: True
      events-file: %ProgramData%\Aurora-Agent\aurora-agent-events.log
   # Response actions 
   dump-path: %ProgramData%\Aurora-Agent\dumps
   # Automatically reload rules directory on changes
   auto-reload: True
   # Debugging settings (output gets only written to STDOUT)
   debug: False
   trace: False

Output Configuration
--------------------

- Log file
- Windows Eventlog
- ASGARD Analysis Cockpit (commercial version only)
- Standard Output (debugging)

Log File 
~~~~~~~~

The log file contains the matching events in JSON format. 

Warning: the local log file doesn't get rotated.

Windows Eventlog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If enabled by setting ``eventlog: True`` Aurora writes entries into the ``Application`` Eventlog with the ``Provider Name`` set to ``Aurora Agent``. 

ASGARD Analysis Cockpit 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever you install an ASGARD Agent, the controlled Aurora Agent Services gets its configuration automatically. In a default setup, all logs generated by an Aurora Agent will be relayed via an ASGARD Management Center to an ASGARD Analysis Cockpit system. 

In special cases, you can configure the correct ASGARD server yourself, using the following option. 

.. code::bash

   log-outputs:
      asgard-server: myasgard.company.local

Standard Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard output can be used for debugging purposes. It contains all the matching events plus debugging and tracing messages when set to ``True`` in the config file.
