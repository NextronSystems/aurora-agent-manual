Configuration
=============

Aurora uses the YAML format for its configuration file. All values set in the config file can also be used as command line flags. There are two use cases in which a configuration file is used.

1. Aurora started from command line using a config passed by the ``--config`` / ``-c`` flag
2. Aurora started as a service with a config file located in ``C:\Program Files\Aurora-Agent\agent-config.yml`` (see chapter :doc:`installation </usage/installation>` for more details)

Examples 
--------

A default configuration file looks like this:

.. code:: yaml
 
   # Paths to your rule files
   rules-path:
      - .\rules
   # The location of log source mapping configurations
   sigma-config: 
      - .\sigma-config.yml
   # Only sigma rule matches of this level and higher will be logged (informational, low, medium, high, critical)
   reporting-level: high
   # Path in which the license file can be found (non-recursive)
   license-path: .\
   # Event matching log output streams
   eventlog: true
   events-file: %ProgramData%\Aurora-Agent\aurora-agent-events.log
   # Response actions 
   dump-path: %ProgramData%\Aurora-Agent\dumps
   # Automatically reload rules and configuration directory on changes
   auto-reload: true
   # Debugging settings (output gets only written to STDOUT and .log file)
   debug: false
   trace: false

A typical configuration file would look like this 

.. code:: yaml
 
   # Paths containing the sigma files
   rules-path:
      - C:\ProgramData\Aurora-Agent\rules
      - C:\ProgramData\Aurora-Agent\myrules
   # Automatically reload the sigma files upon detecting changes
   auto-reload: false
   # Log file path
   logfile: ""
   # Paths to the sigma configurations that should be loaded
   sigma-config:
      - C:\ProgramData\Aurora-Agent\default-log-sources.yml
      - C:\ProgramData\Aurora-Agent\etw-log-sources.yml
   # Print debugging information
   debug: false
   # Print tracing information
   trace: false
   # Log matches to the Windows event log
   eventlog: true
   # Report Sigma matches with rules of this level or higher
   minimum-level: high
   # Folder where process dumps should be stored
   dump-folder: C:\ProgramData\Aurora-Agent\process-dumps
   # Write output as JSON instead of plain text
   json: false
   # Path to the directory containing the Aurora Agent license
   license-path: C:\ProgramData\Aurora-Agent\aurora
   # UDP Address (as host:port) where the Aurora Agent should write its logs to
   udp-target: ""
   # Don't print any logs'
   silent: false
   # Percentage of a single CPU core that the Aurora Agent should use at most
   cpu-limit: 100
   # Log a message about the current agent status once per hour
   report-stats: false
   # How many log rotations should be retained
   log-rotate: 0
   # At which size the log should be rotated
   log-size: 10485760
   # Agent name that the status information pipe and the service name are based on
   agent-name: aurora-agent

Output Options
--------------

The following output options are currently available 

- Windows Eventlog (default)
- Log file
- UDP target (full version only)
- ASGARD Analysis Cockpit (full version only)
- Standard Output

ASGARD Analysis Cockpit 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever you install an ASGARD Agent, the controlled Aurora Agent Services gets its configuration automatically. In a default setup, all logs generated by an Aurora Agent will be relayed via an ASGARD to an Analysis Cockpit system.

Standard Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard output can be used for debugging purposes. It contains all the matching events plus debugging and tracing messages when set to ``True`` in the config file.
